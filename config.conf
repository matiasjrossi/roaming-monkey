## Roaming Monkey example configuration file
############################################
##
## Servers Definitions
######################
## You should be able to define as many asterisk servers as you want. Hopefully
## Roaming Monkey will handle them correctly ;-)
##
## Every server has its own section. The section starts with a header delimited
## by square brackets, specifying the server name (which will be used
## internally as an ID). For this reason server names must be unique.
## NOTE: Server names CANNOT contain whitespace.
[server: pbx.dojo]

##
## Within the server definition there are many mandatory parameters. At first
## you need to tell the monkey where on the network your Asterisk PBX is
## running. If you installed the monkey in the same machine then you can just
## use 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
## Bare in mind that the monkey interacts with asterisk over TCP, so if you
## install both on different machines, you might want to check for any firewall
## or filter between them. 
hostname = localhost

##
## Also Roaming Monkey needs to know in which TCP port is Asterisk Manager
## Interface (AMI) listening for incoming connections. In most cases you're
## good to go with the standard port (5038)
hostport = 5038

##
## Also we need to let the monkey authenticate with AMI. After you add a user
## for Roaming Monkey in the Asterisk Manager configuration files (probably
## under /etc/asterisk/manager.d/) you need to add those credentials here.
## Roaming monkey needs the following privileges to be fully operative:
##   <TODO>
username = avarahamela
password = avarahamela

##
## After the monkey notices a user slipped out of the (W)LAN, it will tell
## Asterisk to process the orphan channel (The one in the otherside of the
## interrupted call) within the dialplan. Here you can specify in which context
## the dialplan execution will begin for this server
redirect_context = internal

##
## Roaming Monkey modifies sip module's configuration to force asterisk detect
## when a client falls out of the (W)LAN.
## Since some asterisk distributors (i.e. Trixbox) make use of included
## configuration files to provide greater customization than its UI allows you
## might need to specify a specific file when the monkey should make its
## changes.
## Defaults to 'sip.conf'
#sip_conf_filename = 

##
## Since some client devices/software might response differently to asterisk
## qualification method, it is posible to tweak the values used by the monkey.
## Define these settings in the server definition section to apply them
## server-wide. If you need to tweak this values in a per client basis, these
## can be defined within a client definition section. (See below) 
## NOTE: Most users won't need to change this at all.
## WARNING: Since this was only tested with defaults, values too far from those
## could make the monkey misbehave.
##
## How much time (in milliseconds) to wait for an answer before considering the
## client as gone. You can increase this parameter to avoid unexpected
## redirections (false positives) in networks with high latency.
## Defaults to '1000'
#oncall_qualify =

##
## How often should asterisk send a qualify test packet to the client. Higher
## values decrease network overhead, but also the redirection detection is less
## accurate. Only increase it if you believe your network is being flooded by
## the monkey.
## The value is time in seconds.
## Defaults to '1'
#oncall_qualifyfreq =


##
## Clients Definitions
######################
## Every monitored client has its own settings in a section delimited with
## square brackets. As you can monitor many servers, you must map every client
## to the server it belongs.
## The syntax is as follows:
## [client: <server> <user>]
[client: pbx.dojo 207]

##
## For each client you need to tell the monkey to which extension (within the
## server-wide defined context) redirect in the event of (W)LAN connection lose.
## Chances are you want to put in it the cellular number of the client. That
## way you can configure your context to dial the extension value through one
## of your outgoing routes (a.k.a. trunk).  
redirect_extension = 0223155328357

##
## NOTE: These settings are per client overrides of the same parameters
## explained in the server section. 
## WARNING: Since this was only tested with defaults, values too far from those
## could make the monkey misbehave.
##
## The value is time in milliseconds.
## Defaults to the value of the server. In case both are undefined defaults to
## '1000' milliseconds.
#oncall_qualify =

##
## The value is time in seconds.
## Defaults to the values specified in the server section. If none, defaults to
## '1' second.
#oncall_qualifyfreq =
